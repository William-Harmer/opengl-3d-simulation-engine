# Custom 3D Engine

This project is a custom 3D engine developed using OpenGL for rendering and FreeGLUT for window management. It features the rendering of a Ferris wheel within a 3D environment. Key functionalities include:

- Dynamic lighting with adjustable Ferris wheel illumination, allowing users to switch between different lighting modes.
- User-controlled Ferris wheel rotation implemented through multiple transformation matrices to accurately simulate realistic motion.
- Support for multiple camera perspectives.
- First-person camera movement and controls enabling user navigation within the scene.
- Collision detection within the 3D space using an octree-based approach.
- OBJ model loading capability.
- Texture management for applying images to models, including support for various texture wrapping modes.
